I fell in love with the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), so I decided to port it to my favourite notetaking app, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Halcyon is dark-mode only, but _soon_ very customizable through [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings), see [customization](customization---style-settings).

## Installation

You can install Halcyon through Obsidian, or manually.

### Through Obsidian (Recommended)

1. Go to `settings > appearance`.
2. Click **Manage** next to _Themes_.
3. Search for **Halcyon**.
4. Click **Install and use**.
5. Enjoy using my favourite theme! ðŸ¥³

### Manual

> Note: manually installed themes do not get updated automatically.
> You should prefer installing through obsidian if possible.

1. Download [the latest release](#) as ZIP file.
2. Extract the folder into your vault's `.obsidian/themes` folder.
3. Go to `settings > appearance`.
4. Select **Halcyon** from the dropdown list.
5. Enjoy using my favourite theme! ðŸ¥³

## Known Issues

There are a few limitations that are outside of my control as theme developer. Here's a list of them.

* Putting a [codeblock](<https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code+blocks>)  (` ```language `) inside a [quote](<https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Quotes>)  `>` is not recognized by the underlying parser.
* We cannot style a `dataviewjs` codeblock from the [Dataview plugin](<obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview>) the same way as normal `js`, because the underlying parser doesn't recognize it as `javascript`.
