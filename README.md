# Halcyon for Obsidian

![banner-image](img/halcyon-banner-github.png)

I fell in love with the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), so I decided to port it to my favourite notetaking app, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Halcyon is dark-mode only.

## Installation

You can install Halcyon through Obsidian, or manually.

### Through Obsidian (Recommended)

1. Go to `settings > appearance`.
2. Click **Manage** next to _Themes_.
3. Search for **Halcyon** (make sure you can see dark-mode themes).
4. Click **Install and use**.
5. Enjoy using my favourite theme! ðŸ¥³

### Manual

> Note: manually installed themes do not get updated automatically.
> You should prefer installing through obsidian if possible.

1. Download [the latest release](#) as ZIP file.
2. Extract the folder into your vault's `.obsidian/themes` folder.
3. Go to `settings > appearance`.
4. Select **Halcyon** from the dropdown list.
5. Enjoy using my favourite theme! ðŸ¥³

## Plugin Support

-   [Chetachi](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor)'s [Highlightr](obsidian://show-plugin?id=highlightr-plugin) plugin: when selecting `css-classes` as option, it will by default use the Halcyon colors for its highlights.

## Style Settings

As of version `0.0.4` there is now a basic support for style settings.
This version is still _work in progress_ and unreleased, but the code has been pushed to git.

## Known Issues

There are a few limitations that are outside of my control as theme developer. Here's a list of them.

-   Putting a [codeblock](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code+blocks) (` ```language `) inside a [quote](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Quotes) `>` is not recognized by the underlying parser.
-   We cannot style a `dataviewjs` codeblock from the [Dataview plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview) the same way as normal `js`, because the underlying parser doesn't recognize it as `javascript`.

_Did you find more issues? Let me know by making an [issue](https://github.com/dbarenholz/halcyon-obsidian/issues)!_

## Contributing

Feel like making Halcyon even better? Have a look at the issues with the `accepting PRs` label [here](<https://github.com/dbarenholz/halcyon-obsidian/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22accepting+PRs%22>).
If an issue does not have that label, but it's something you want in the theme, make sure to ping me on the issue. It would be a shame if you spent your time on something that clashes with my vision for Halcyon.

To build the theme, use `npm run build`. This will do the following:

1. Run the linter `npm run lint`.
2. Compile scss to css for both the theme and publish `npm run compile`.
3. Merge in style settings and the license file `npm run merge`.

For more details, see `package.json`.
